# Shape2Vec
Shape2Vec: semantic-based descriptors for 3D shapes, sketches and images

Dataset used to train Shape2Vec:

* 3D Shapes & Depthmaps
We rendered depth images using the SHREC'14 large scale retrieval benchmark: http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/vug/sharp/contest/2014/Generic3D/
Download all depth images (6 renderings from random viewpoints for each shape): https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/shape2vec-datasets/public/SHREC14LSSTB_TARGET_MODELS_DEPTHMAPS.zip
 
* Sketches
We use the SHREC'14 extended large scale sketch-based shape retrieval benchmark: http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/vug/sharp/contest/2014/SBR/
